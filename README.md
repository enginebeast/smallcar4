While working on my project, I realized that IR remote control wasn't suitable my project. The IR sensor doesn't work properly when obstacles block the signal. So, I decided to find another way to control my RC car.

First, I considered modifying the prototype RC car remote control. But, I canceled this decision, because I wasn't convinced that I was able to make arduino to receive radio waves of prototype remote control. 

Second, I considered using a smartphone remote control app with a Bluetooth module to control the RC car. Although the app maker’s UI for Arduino is limited, this isn’t a big problem. Initially, my goal in creating a remote control system was simply to check whether the RC car was working correctly, so I didn’t need detailed control. If I want more advanced control in the future, I can solve it at the Raspberry Pi level.

First, I create the smartphone app UI to use MIT app inventor which is web site that helps you quikly build smartphone apps.

But, there was a problem that UI is not user-friendly because, it's too close together.

I think it's because there is a function that arranges automatically. So, I inserted text labels filled with spaces between buttons, and it worked well.

Next, I programed the app using block editor of MIT app inventor. The above parts are used to connect the smartphone app to the Arduino via a Bluetooth module. I’ll add a link here once I’ve made the document explaining how it works.

The above parts are used to send 1-byte number to Bluetooth module during I click the button. During I push down left of right button, an unvisible interface, clock become True. On the other way, if I push up a botton, clock become False.
